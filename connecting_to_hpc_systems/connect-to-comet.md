## <a name="term-app"></a>How to Use the Terminal Application:

The terminal applications are used to connect clients (you and your laptop) to remote computers (such as Comet). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell for more information. The best known example of using a terminal is for logging in/connecting to a remote computer systems by users. This is called a client-server connection. Terminals are interactive: you type in a command to run, and the outputs are displayed on the terminal. Executing any command is done by typing it and pressing Enter.

SSH provides a secure channel over any network in a client-server architecture. You will be using your laptop to access SDSCâ€™s HPC systems using the secure shell command `ssh`. It is essential that you be able to run secure shell (or a similar connection tool) with X11 forwarding enabled, which allows you to have data encryption and to launch windows applications (e.g. plotting, or a browser).

*NOTE: The `hostname` for Comet is `comet.sdsc.edu`

## <a name="term-app-mac-users"></a>Mac Users
For Mac users, the Terminal application is typically used for connections. This is done from the command line:

    ssh -X username@<hostname>

 If you are having trouble, try running `ssh` in verbose mode:

     ssh -v -X username@hostname

## <a name="term-app-windows"></a>MSFT Windows 
All windows users will need to run a terminal emulation application capable of supporting an X Server and an ssh-like client.

### <a name="term-app-windows10"></a>Windows 10
Windows Terminal is a terminal emulator for Windows 10 written by Microsoft. It includes support for the Command Prompt, PowerShell, WSL and SSH. The terminal emulator is described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Terminal.

To download and install the PowerShell application, see here [ Available Jan 30, 2020: ] : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell/download-and-install-windows-powershell-5-1

### <a name="term-app-windows-older"></a> Windows (pre-Win10)
Older  [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) provides a comprehensive Linux-like environment and an X server (Cygwin/X). Putty will also work for direct access to Comet, it is only used for file transfers. For download and installation instructions, see:

## <a name="term-app-dn-info"></a>Getting Domain Name & Host Information
Each machine you work with will have a `<domain_name>`,  `<hostname>` or `<ip_address>`. You can learn about IP addresses and domain names here: https://computer.howstuffworks.com/dns.htm.

* NOTE: The *DN* (domain name) for Comet is    `comet.sdsc.edu`

You may need to know the physical IP address of the cluster. To do this, run the `nslookup` command from the command line of your terminal window
```
[username@comet:] nslookup comet.sdsc.edu
Server:		192.168.86.1
Address:	192.168.86.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	comet.sdsc.edu
Address: 198.202.113.253
Name:	comet.sdsc.edu
Address: 198.202.113.252
```

The IP address is the  line labeled "Address" and for Comet there are two. YOu can log onto Comet using either the DN or the IP addresses.
